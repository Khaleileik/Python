Objective: The objective of this program is to make a hangman game

Algorithm:
    1.) Define a function that randomly selects a word from a text dictionary/list
    2.) Define a function that takes inputs from the user for each letter guessed
    3.) Define function that will take the letter guessed correctly and turn it into a string
    4.) Create variables to store data that the user enters
        a. Create a variable that stores the variable that the computer picks
        b. Create two variables, one that holds correct letters guessed and one that holds wrong guesses
    5.) Display an introduction to the program so the users know what to do
    6.) Create a loop that will allow the user to keep guessing until they win or run out of tries
    7.) Add statements at the beginning and end of the game to welcome users and thank them for playing
