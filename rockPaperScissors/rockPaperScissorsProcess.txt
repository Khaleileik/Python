Objective:
this program will allow the user to play rock paper scissors against the computer

We will...
-create code that checks who won each round
-create code that takes the input(choices) from the user
-create code that takes 'input' from the computer
-check if the user wants to quit or if the user doesn't enter either one of the options
-loops each round of the game
-add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
-loop the whole game, so that they can keep playing until they choose to quit 

Pseudocode:

set variable keepPlaying to true

while keepPlaying is true:

    print statement welcoming players to the game
    print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 press "q" to quit)
    
    make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    
    (rock is 1, paper is 2, scissors is 3)
    
    import the random function - the computer makes its choice randomly from this function
    
        set computer's score to 0
        set player's score to 0
        
        while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2: --this means that the game is still on
        
            computer's choice  = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used here) random.randint(1,3)
            player's choice = input(ask player to select rock, paper, or scissors)
            
        start checking user options
        userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        if player inputs 'q': --player wants to end the game 
            set keepPlaying to False --ends the loop
            stop the loop --whoo! break statement
            
        else if (player inputs rock and computer rock) or 
        (player inputs scissors and comp
            print out DRAW
            print out player's score and computer's score
        
        else if(player inputs rock and computer chooses paper) or 
        (player inputs paper and computer chooses scissors) or 
        (player inputs scissors and computer chooses rock)
            add one to computer's score
            print out player's score and computer's score     
            
         else if(player inputs scissors and computer chooses paper) or 
         (player inputs rock and computer chooses scissors) or 
         (player inputs paper and computer chooses rock)
            add one to player's's score
            print out player's score and computer's score    
            
        else:
            tell user their input was not valid
            
    print statment thanking the player for playing
    if player's score is 2
        print statement letting the player know they one
    if the computer's score is 2
        print statement letting the player know the computer one
